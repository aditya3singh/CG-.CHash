//Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type.
//Unboxing is the process of converting a type object back to a value type.

//how boxing is implicit and unboxing is explicit
//Boxing is implicit because the conversion from a value type to an object type is done automatically by the runtime.
//Unboxing is explicit because the conversion from an object type back to a value type requires a cast.
